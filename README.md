### _Note to Self_ 

I am currently investigating about the use cases of Google Maps API. 
After being able to get the location of the user based on its IP (assuming the user directly agrees to said transaction of information) my goal is to create a virtual 3km x 3km radius around the user and lists coffee places around him.
Further updates might add the use of databases to store the information of certain coffee shops as well as, possibly, the ability of rating said coffee places.
